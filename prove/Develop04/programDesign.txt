The program has one base class Activity. This class contains the attributes and methods
that are common to all activities. Certain functions are put into separate classes as follows:

Animation class is responsible for displaying the spinner animation for a given duration.
Countdown class is responisble for displaying the countdown with the interval of 1 second.

BreathingActivity, ReflectionActivity, and ListingActivity classes are derived from the base
Activity class. They have attributes and methods that are unique to each of them.
RunActivity() method is named the same, but it performs differently for each activity.

The BreathingActivity class has no attributes. It just contains the RunActivity() method.
That is sufficient for this class.

The ReflectionActivity class uses two other classes: ReflectionPromptGenerator and
ReflectionQuestionGenerator.

ReflectionPrompGenerator provides random prompts for the ReflectionActivity class.
ReflectionQuestionGenerator provides random Questions for the ReflectionActivity class.

The ListingActivity class has an attribute which is used to count the number of items
that a user types during this activity. It also uses another class: ListingPromptGenerator.

ListingPromptGenerator provides random prompts for the ListingActivity class.
